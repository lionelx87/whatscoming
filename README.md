# whatsComing :cloud:

**whatsComing** :rocket: was conceived under the idea of generating a space where to obtain information about the weather of a specific place in an agile, fast and visually friendly way. Although there are many services that provide this information, the idea is that little by little it will become (at least) my favorite choice.. Currently the data provided is obtained from the [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) service.

### What information does it provide? :gift:
* Current temperature accompanied by a description of the sky condition.
* Maximum temperature.
* Minimum Temperature.
* Humidity.
* Clouds.
* Wind.
* Forecast (for 3 days including the current day, due to api limitation).
  * Maximum temperature.
  * Minimum Temperature.
